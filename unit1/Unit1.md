## Unit 1 Introduction To Academic Genres

### High School English Vs University English

In the university setting, the academic expectations are different from what you have experienced in secondary school. You are expected to read and write longer articles, as well as critically analyse multiple sources of information. In order to perform well in university assessments, you will need to apply academic English skills effectively. The University English I and II courses are designed to equip you with the necessary academic English skills to facilitate your transition from secondary school to university studies.

### Activity 1 - Discussion Get Into Groups Of 3-4. Discuss The Following Questions:

1. What might be major differences between high school and university reading texts?
2. What might be major differences between high school and university assignments?
3. What challenges might you encounter when completing university assignments? What can you do to overcome these challenges?

### What Are Genres?

Genres represent different patterns of organization of information in texts which are used to serve situation-specific purposes. One example of a genre is the academic essay, which enables students to display their mastery of the requisite knowledge or skills taught in a course in a specific style and format, drawing upon a finite range of 'appropriate' words. The particular features of any genre are determined by the **purpose, audience (or readership), context, as well as the established conventions for the genre**.

Johns, A. M., Bawarshi, A., Coe, R. M., Hyland, K., Paltridge, B., Reiff, M. J., & Tardy, C. (2006). Crossing the boundaries of genre studies: Commentaries by experts. _Journal of Second Language Writing_, 15(3), 234-249.

### What Are Academic Genres?

Academic genres are distinct types of written or spoken texts which are prepared for academic purposes in the academic community. Some examples of academic genres include **journal articles, book chapters,** research proposals, conference proceedings, textbooks, theses/dissertations, and conference presentations.

At university, you will be asked to write different types of academic texts belonging to different genres.

Depending on your disciplines, you may need to familiarize yourself with a variety of different genres in order to produce a wide range of text types such as essays, research papers/reports, laboratory reports, project proposals, project reports, case studies, reviews, critiques, and reflective journals.

### What Is Genre Analysis?

To determine the genre, we can begin with any given text and 'go backwards' to identify (or 'deconstruct') the different components of the text. By identifying the different characteristics which make up the text, we can see more clearly how they relate to the author's overall purpose, context, and existing conventions for the genre. This analysis can be conducted by answering questions in relation to three dimensions of the text: 2 1. Global (whole text and beyond) level: Structure How is the text organized/structured?

How are sections and subsections labeled? When and how are terms defined?

### Audience

Where and how is the audience indicated? Is it clear what the audience can be expected to already know or believe?

How does the text engage with its target audience?

### Purpose

Where and how is the overall purpose indicated? What are the different functions of the sentences (introduce the background/define relevant terminology/state the stance, etc.)?

### Support

How are claims stated and supported?

How much context or background information is provided?

What types of evidence are used and how? How is the credibility of the evidence indicated?

2. Sentence and Word level: How is the document formatted?

How are sentences structured? What types of punctuation are used? What verb tenses are used? Is passive or active voice used? Are personal pronouns (I/we/you) or determiners (my/our/your) used? Are there examples of technical/professional terminology?

3. Voice and Tone: How confident does the author sound and how can you tell? How formal or informal is the tone? Is the author biased or objective?

### Audience - Purpose - Context

The features of a genre are determined by the audience, purpose and context of communication. All three

![3\_image\_0.png](3\_image\_0.png) components (Audience-Purpose-Context) are interrelated and relate directly to the language choices in any kind of text:

### Audience Activity 2 - Discussion (Audience) Part 1:

a. Scenario 1: You are a professor preparing to give a presentation at a university.

b. Scenario 2: You are writing a blog post on your website reviewing new anime films and shows.

1. What kind of people comprise the audience demographic groups for these two scenarios (who is in the audience)?
2. How will the language used differ to meet the expectations of the respective audience/ readership?

### Part 2: Read The Excerpts Below From Two Sources And Answer The Question That Follows. Text A:

Online dating has significantly changed the courses of romantic courtship and relationships, and online dating is the most popular way couples in the U.S. meet today (Rosenfeld et al., 2019). In a recent report (Anderson et al., 2020), 54% of U.S. respondents stated that online dating was just as successful compared to relationships that begin in person. One of the key technical facilitators in online dating is app-based geosocial networking platforms designed for online dating.

Dai, M., & Robbins, R. (2021). Exploring the influences of profile perceptions and different pick-up lines on dating outcomes on tinder: An online experiment. _Computers in Human Behavior_, 117, 106667.

### Text B:

The size of the dataset was impressive. So was the information contained in it. For each couple, Joel and her team of researchers had measures of how happy each partner reported being in their relationship.

And they had data on just about anything you could think to measure about the two people in that relationship.

Stephens-Davidowitz, S. (2022, May 10). People are dating all wrong, according to data science. _Wired._ https://www.wired.com/story/data-marriage-behavior-love-psychology-romance/#intcid=\_wired-versohp-trending\_e5d09360-7de7-4e94-891e-15a02f0d018e\_popular4-1 What can you deduce about the audiences of the above texts? Why?

### Purpose Activity 3 - Discussion (Purpose) Part 1:

| Entertain | Inform               | Persuade           |
| --------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| e.g. Blog | e.g. Official notice | e.g. Advertisement |

The purpose of a text can be divided into three general categories: Entertain, **Inform**, and **Persuade**. Brainstorm about examples of genres associated with these three **major purposes (it should be noted** that often times a given genre will achieve multiple purposes, e.g., **persuade and entertain):** At the word level, typically there are two scales which can be quite useful in determining the purpose of a text, namely _formality_ and _objectivity_\*\*. Take a look at Text A and Text B below, and determine:\*\* (i) if the language used is relatively more formal or informal, as well as objective or subjective

* What words seem to provide clues regarding the formality and objectivity of the text?

(ii) the purposes of the texts

* Based on the word choices, what do you feel are the purposes of the respective texts?

Are they the same or different? Why?

Part 2: 6

### Text A:

Unethical design is put into play when companies go on "the race to the bottom of the brainstem".

Persuasion techniques have always been used in apps. A classic example is the slot machine design where users pull up to reload the screen. Just like the slot machines in Vegas people continue to go onto the apps and pull the slot machine hoping for new notifications, messages or content. This is not unethical design. However, something like snapchat streaks is a problem.

A race to the bottom of the brainstem. (n.d.). _University of Colorado Boulder: ATLAS Institute_.

### Text B:

Beyond minor relational disturbances, participants also indicated that Snapchat could facilitate deviant behavior within interpersonal relationships. Participants specifically discussed cheating, saving and disseminating incriminating snaps, and cyberbullying. Since photos on Snapchat are deleted after a set amount of time, young adults shared that some users utilize the app for "sexting." Sexting via Snapchat was reportedly used between romantic partners, but could also facilitate relational infidelity.

Vaterlaus, J. M., Barnett, K., Roche, C., & Young, J. A. (2016). "Snapchat is more personal": An exploratory study on Snapchat behaviors and young adult interpersonal relationships. _Computers in Human Behavior, 62_, 594-601.

### Context

The prefix 'con' can be found in quite a few words, such as 'construct', 'confederate', and 'conjoin'. You can likely think of many other additional examples. If you examine these words in different contexts, you will find they share a common meaning element - contiguity ('things joined in continuous connection').

Thus, context represents everything around the text that shapes its meaning (how it is interpreted by the reader or listener).

For instance, if someone in a room said, "It's stuffy in here", this utterance could be understood in many different ways. Maybe it is functioning as a complaint about the broken air conditioner, or perhaps it is a suggestion that it is a suitable time to leave the room. There are indeed endless possibilities, but without knowing the specific context surrounding the utterance (people/situation, etc.), there is no way to definitively retrieve the original speaker's intended meaning. Context changes according to situation, but also according to culture: What is regarded as appropriate in one culture may be considered inappropriate in a different cultural setting.

2. Writing an email to your professors: "Hey, when's the _homework due? Thx!"_
3. Asking your mom for money: "Dearest Mother, could you possibly provide me with some additional funding to purchase an electronic communication device?"

## Activity 5 - Reading And Discussion

Online dating apps as a marketing channel: A **generational approach** Rita, P., Ramos, R. F., Moro, S., Mealha, M., & Radu, L. (2020)

### 1. Introduction

In a world driven by electronic word-of-mouth based on Social Media (SM) platforms, marketers have taken it into an advantage to procure new relationships between brands, potential customers and developing existing ones (Litterio et al., 2017). In this less tangible and sophisticated era, individuals have changed their roles as consumers, since they take an autonomous part in seeking information about products/services of their interest, making it possible to acquire nearly everything with a simple "click" (Ramos et al., 2019). On a global scale, there are 2.25 billion users of SM daily (Statista, 2017). The average adult (18+) spent about 2 h and 25 min a day in navigating on SM in 2017, with Generation Y taking the most significant portion of that daily usage, with around 3 h and 72 min (Statista, 2017). This shift in user behavior entails companies to reconsider their marketing strategies inside the digital world, by turning their head to relationship-based interactions with their target market, to improve marketing engagement (Stojanovic et al., 2018). As a result, marketers have transformed their roles. In this paradigm, there are two leading SM platforms marketers tend to focus on when they decide to invest in digital marketing: Facebook and Instagram (Voorveld et al., 2018).

Nevertheless, the increasing number of media channels turned the media effectiveness challenging. Time and attention have turned into a rare assent for users, and the number of alternative ways of communication influence the quantity and type of communication (Hartemo, 2016). Although advertising has a positive effect and visibility on brand equity (Abril & Rodriguez-Cánovas, 2016), it has become less efficient. In a situation of high quantity, there are too many ads concentrated in one channel claiming for the users' attention, putting in jeopardy the effects of memory, behaviors toward the ad, attitude, advertised product and even the channel itself where the communication occurs (Rejón-Guardia & Martínez-López, 2014). The main reason to download a dating app is due to its mass marketing popularity and peer influence (LeFebvre, 2017). The game-like swiping characteristic of these apps makes its navigation almost addictive, resulting in placing them into the entertaining app category (Sumter et al., 2017). The age group of 25–34 holds a substantial share of online dating activity with a value of 42.2%, with a total of 279.2 million worldwide users in 2017, and a forecast to reach 331.3 users by 2022 (Statista, 2018).

Although a few marketing campaigns have been executed on dating apps, academia has not developed efforts to understand the receptivity of a dating app as a marketing tool. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation is to explore the willingness to receive intrusive marketing communications through a dating app, and if there are statistical differences between generations for its acceptance. To achieve this objective, 411 user reactions were collected from Tinder after the launch of a marketing campaign, providing the corpus for analysis. Sentiment analysis was adopted to rank the responses, thus enabling us to understand the types of user feedback toward marketing communication and a Kruskal-Wallis H test to comprehend if there are statistical differences between each generation. Although the creative aspect of marketing communication is not considered, from a marketer's perspective, it is crucial to understand how dating apps users react facing marketing communication, considering that the channel 9

### Influences Its Effect.

Using generational cohorts permit an additional understanding of the users' response toward a marketing campaign, as each group is perfectly delimited by a particular period and involves people who were born within a specific period, with similar values, experiences and priorities (Bento et al., 2018). The period when the audience was born can provide indicators of target groups and interests and particular insights of each generational microculture.

By uncovering the users' reactions, this paper intends to bring valuable insights for scientific literature and marketers by understanding if an online dating app is an appropriate channel to conduct marketing activities since there is a positive correlation between channel acceptance and ad attitude (Bakr et al., 2019), and if audience generation is a determinant for its acceptance.
